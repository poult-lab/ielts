*Max wants to be a basketball player, **yet** he never practices.*

How are *but* and *yet* similar in these sentences? They both introduce a contrast. That much is clear. Also, *yet* does sound more formal. However, there is a subtle difference in the two intended meanings--in the *feeling* of each sentence. Perhaps you can see and feel the difference, but you cannot quite express *why* these two sentences are slightly different. So, what is the difference? In the simplest terms:

1. *But* introduces a contrast and simply treats it as a fact with little or no emotional component.
2. *Yet* introduces a contrast, but it also expresses a feeling of expectation, surprise, or mystery.

When we say "Max wants to be  a basketball player, yet he never practices," we feel that he should practice. We expect him to practice. "Why isn't he practicing?" we wonder. It is surprising, and perhaps even confusing, that he does not practice. With all of this in mind, we can see that ***yet*** **shows a stronger contrast** with the elements of expectation, surprise, and/or mystery mentioned above.
